\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Production function solves:
   \begin{itemize}
       \item What is the level of returns to scale?
       \item How do input coefficients on capital and labor change over time?
       \item How does adoption of a new technology affect production?(Shock)
       \item How much heterogeneity is there in measured productivity across firms, and what explains it?(IO)
       \item How does the allocation of firm inputs relate to productivity?(allocation)
   \end{itemize}
   
   \item Production function also solves:
   \begin{itemize}
       \item dynamic models of industry evolution
       \item evaluation of firm conduct(e.g.collusion)
   \end{itemize}
   
   \item Here, we will work with two input C-D production function: \[ Y_i=e^{\beta_0}K_i^{\beta_1}L_i^{\beta_2}e^{\epsilon_i}\]
   where \(i\) indexes firms, \(K_i\) is units of labor, \(L_i\) is units of output. \((\beta_0,\beta_1,\beta_2)\) are parameters and \(\epsilon_i\) captures unobservables that affects output (e.g. weather, soil quality, management quality)
   
   \item Take natural logs:
   \[y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1k_i+\beta_2l_i+\epsilon_i\]
   
   \item The function can be extended to additional inputs: R{\&}D, dummies representing discrete technologies, different types of labor/capital, intermediate inputs
 \end{itemize}
 
 
 \section{Endogeneity Issues}
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Problem:
     \begin{enumerate}
         \item Inputs\(k_i\),\(l_i\) are typically choices variable of firms
         \item Firms choose inputs to maximize profits, and hence will often depend on unobservables \(\epsilon_1\).
         \item The dependence depends on what the firm knows about\(\epsilon_i\) when they make these input choices.
         \item Example: Suppose a firm operating in perfectly competitive output and input markets(with respective prices \(p_i\), \(r_i\),\(w_i\)), and perfectly observes \(\epsilon_i\) before optimally choosing inputs. 
         \\ Profit maximization problem is :
         \[\max\limits_{K_i,L_i} p_i e^{\beta_0}K_i^{\beta_1}L_i^{\beta_2}e^{\epsilon_i}-r_i K_i-w_i L_i\]
     \end{enumerate}
     
     \item FOC of the optimal function implies that \(K_i\) and \(L_i\) (\(k_i\) and \(l_i\)) will depend on \(\epsilon_i\).
     \\ Intuition: \(\epsilon_i\) which can be seen as productivity positively affects marginal product of inputs.
     \item Endogeneity issue: one cannot estimate 
     \[y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1k_i+\beta_2l_i+\epsilon_i\]
     using OLS because of the correlation. The coefficient would be positively biased.
     \item In some more complicated models(e.g. non-perfectly competitive output or input markets, \(\epsilon_i\) only partially observed), except the special case where the firm has not knowledge of \(\epsilon_i\) when choosing inputs \underline{(in this case, both firms and economists don't know the productivity, }
     \\\underline{and thus the productivity is exogenous)}
     
     \item \(k_i\) is less correlated with \(\epsilon_i\) than \(l_i\) is: \(k_i\) is a "less variable" input than \(l_i\) because one might expect the firm to be less knowledge about \(\epsilon_i\) when choosing \(k_i\).\underline{ This is because \(k_i\) is decided by firms in previous period, }
     \underline{in which firm has little knowledge of \(\epsilon_i\).}
     
     \item WLOG,let's think about \(\epsilon_i\) above having 2 components (\(\omega_i\) and \(\epsilon_i\)), so that we can rewrite the equation as:
     \[y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1k_i+\beta_2l_i+\omega_i+\epsilon_i\]
     where:
     \begin{itemize}
         \item \(\omega_i\) is an unobservable that is predictable (or partially predictable) to the firm when it makes its input decisions
         \item  \(\epsilon_i\) is an unobservable that the firm has no information about when making input decisions. \(\epsilon_i\) could also represent measurement error in output.
         \item in this formulation, \(\omega_i\) causes the endogeneity problem, which is called the "productivity shock".
     \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 
 \section{Traditional Solutions}
There are two traditional solutions to endogeneity problems : instrumental variables and fixed effects model.
\subsection{Instrumental Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic idea: Find "instruments" that are 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item correlated with the endogenous inputs \(k_i\) and \(l_i\)
        \item not directly determine \(y_i\)
        \item not correlated with \(\omega_i\) and \(\epsilon_i\)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Consider input and output prices \(w_i\), \(r_i\) and \(p_i\).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These prices will affect firms' optimal choices of \(k_i\) and \(l_i\)
        \item These prices are excluded from the production function as they do not directly determin output \(y_i\) conditional on the inputs
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item The problem is when will be the case that \(w_i\), \(r_i\) and \(p_i\) are not correlated with the productivity shock \(\omega_i\).
    
    \item One key issue is the form of competition in input and output markets:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(p_i\) will be negatively correlated with \(\omega_i\), invalidating \(p_i\) as an instrument:
         \\If output markets are imperfectly competitive (i.e. firms face downward sloping demand curves), then a higher \(\omega_i\) will increase a firm's output supply ,driving \(p_i\) down.
         \item \(w_i\) and/or \(r_i\) may be positively correlated with \(\omega_i\), invalidating them as instruments:
         \\If input markets are imperfectly competitive(i.e. firms face upward sloping supply curves), then a higher \(\omega_i\) will increase a firm's input demand, driving \(w_i\) and/or \(r_i\) up.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item To use these instruments, firms must be operated in perfectly competitive input or output markets. \underline{Typically, this is more believable for} \underline{ input markets than for output markets.}
    
    \item Problem: IV solutions haven't been broadly used in practice because:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item one needs data on \(w_i\) and \(r_i\).
        \item there is often very little variation in \(w_i\) and \(r_i\) across firms (often there is a real question of whether observed variation operate in different input markets?)
        \item one often wonders whether observed variation in e.g \(w-i\) actually represents firms facing different input prices, or whether it represents things like variation in unobserved labor quality (i.e. the firm with the higher \(w_i\) is employing workers of higher quality.)
        \\\underline{If latter, then \(w_i\) is not a valid instrument.}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item While there might be "true" variation in input prices across time, this is usually not helpful, because if one has data across time, one often wants to allow the production function to change across time (i.e. \(f_t(k_{it},l_{it})\)),
    e.g.
    \[y_{it}=\beta_{0t}+\beta_1k_{it}+\beta_2l_{it}+\omega_{it}+\epsilon_{it}\]
    
    \item To sum up, if one can find a market where there is convincing exogenous input price variation, IV approach is probably more convincing than the approaches in the rest of this note.
    
    \item Notes:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Randomized experiments: either directly manipulating inputs, or manipulating input prices.
        \item In this note, an implicit "homogeneous treatment effects" assumption is made. A heterogeneous treatment effects model would be
        \[y_i=\beta_0+\beta_{1i}k_i+\beta_{2i}l_i+\omega_i+\epsilon_i\]
        This affects the interpretation of IV estimators, e.g. Heckman and Robb (1985),Angrist and Imbens(1994, Ecta)
        \item If there are unobserved firm choice variables in \(\omega_i\), it becomes quite hard to find valid instruments, even with the above assumption.
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fixed Effects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The approach relies on having panel data on firms across time, i.e.
    \[y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_1k_{it}+\beta_2l_{it}+\omega_{it}+\epsilon_{it}\]
    \item assume:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\epsilon_{it}\) is independent across \(t\)(intuition: \(\epsilon_{it}\) is not predictable by the firm when choosing \(k_{it}\) and \(l_{it}\))
        \item the productivity shock is constant over time (fixed effect assumption), i.e.
        \[w_{it}=w_i\]
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Then one can either mean difference
    \[y_{it}-\bar{y_i}=\beta_1(k_{it}-\bar{k_i})+\beta_2(l_{it}-\bar{l_i})+(\epsilon_{it}-\bar{\epsilon_i})\]
    or first difference
    \[y_{it}-\bar{y_{it-1}}=\beta_1(k_{it}-\bar{k_{it-1}})+\beta_2(l_{it}-\bar{l_{it-1}})+(\epsilon_{it}-\bar{\epsilon_{it-1}})\]
    Since the problematic unobservable \(\omega_{it}\) have been difference out of these expressions (recall that we have assume that the \(\epsilon_{it} are uncorrelated with input choices\)), these equation can be estimated with OLS.
    
    \item Problems:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\omega_{it}\)=\(\omega_i\) is a strong assumption
        \item These estimators often produce strange estimates. In particular, they often generate very small (or even negative) capital coefficients. \underline{Perhaps this is due to measurement error in capital.}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Other notes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mean Difference Approach vs First Difference Approach:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The mean difference approach requires all the input choices to be uncorrelated with all the \(\epsilon_{it}\) (strict exogeneity).
            \item The first difference approach only requires current and lagged inputs to be uncorrelated with current and lagged \(\epsilon_{it}\). Using \(k_{it-1}\) and \(l_{it-1}\) (or other lags) as instruments for (\(k_{it}\)-\(k_{it-1}\)) and (\(l_{it}\)-\(l_{it-1}\)), one can allow current inputs to be arbitrarily correlated with past \(\epsilon_{it}\) (sequential exogeneity)
        \end{enumerate}
        
        \item Panel data approach can be extended to richer error structures (Arellano and Bond (1991, ReStud), Arellano and Bover (1995, JoE), Blundell and Bond (1998, JoE; 2000, ER), Arellano and Honore (2001, Handbook)), e.g.
        \[\omega_{it}=\rho\omega_{it-1}+\xi_{it}\]
        or
        \[\omega_{it}=\alpha_i+\lambda_{it}\] where \[\lambda_{it}=\rho\lambda_{it-1}+\xi_{it}\]
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{First Order Conditions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The approach to estimating production function is based on information in the FOCs of optimizing firms.
    
    \item For a firm operating in perfectly competitive input and output markets, static cost minimization implies that
    \[\frac{\partial Y}{\partial L} \frac{L}{y}=\frac{wL}{pY}\]
    i.e. the output elasticity w.r.t an input must equal its (cost) share in revenue.
    
    \item In a C-D context, these output elasticities are the production function coefficients \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\), so observations on these revenue shares across firms could provide estimates of the coefficients.
    
    \item Note that \(r\) can often be assumed known (interest rate or sth. equivalent) and often one directly observes \(wL\) and \(pY\) (rather than L and Y - i.e. labor input and output are measured in terms of dollar units (that are implicitly assumed to be comparable across firms))
    
    \item Problem:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item This assumes static cost minimization - i.e. it assumes away dynamics, adjustment costs, etc. At the very least, we often think about the capital input being subject to a dynamic accumulation process, e.g. $K_{it}=\delta K_{it-1}+i_{it-1}$
        \item There are additional terms when firms are not operating in perfectly competitive markets, e.g. when firms face downward sloping demand curve
        \[\frac{\partial Y}{\partial L}\frac{L}{Y}=\mu \frac{wL}{pY}\]
        \[\frac{\partial Y}{\partial K}\frac{L}{K}=\mu \frac{rK}{pY}\]
        where $\mu=\frac{p}{mc}$, i.e. percentage markup. Note that profit maximization implies $\frac{p}{mc}=\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}$, where \(\epsilon\) is the elasticity of demand. So, for example, one could still identify production coefficients using this method if the elasticity of demand was known (Hsieh and Klenow (2009, QJE)). Or one might be able to identify both with additional restrictions, e.g. CRS (related to Hall (1988, JPE))
